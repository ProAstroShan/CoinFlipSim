# CoinFlipSim
A coin flipping game based on an existing game called “Unfair Flips”. This is a python recreation, though some things may not be the same.

To play the game, just load the code into an IDE (Preferably Google Colab) and run it. This program will create a folder in your google drive called CoinFlipSim, which will contain the save file for the game which is called DataBackup.json. This program was originally created in Google Colab and has not been tested in other IDEs, so it may not work as intended. You probably will encounter bugs and glitches. Enjoy!
